### Smoke test

The repository includes a `tests/` directory with a minimal config for smoke testing. To run a smoke test locally (inside the Docker image):

```bash
conda activate postgwas_py39
nextflow run . -profile test -params-file tests/params.yaml
```

Replace `-profile test` with `-profile local` for a local run using your `params.yaml`.
