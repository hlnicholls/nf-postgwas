This page shows quick runnable examples and references to the `tests/` directory included with this repository.

### Smoke test

The repository includes a `tests/` directory with a minimal config for smoke testing. To run a smoke test locally (inside the Docker image):

```bash
conda activate postgwas_py39
nextflow run . -profile test -params-file tests/params.yaml
```

Replace `-profile test` with `-profile local` for a local run using your `params.yaml`.


### Synthetic GWAS Example

Synthetic GWASs have been generated in ```/nf-postgwas/data/input/tests/synthetic_1kg_GWAS```. The default settings in `params.yaml` are set to use this `trait1` GWAS to run through the pipeline (with mounting the databases from huggingface: <https://huggingface.co/datasets/hlnicholls/postgwas-db-grch38-2025-11>)

**Results are random and for example only. They are not associated with any real trait**

To run the pipeline with this synthetic data:

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 hlnicholls/postgwas-pipeline:latest

git clone https://github.com/hlnicholls/nf-postgwas.git

# in the repo directory download https://huggingface.co/datasets/hlnicholls/postgwas-db-grch38-2025-11

# keep the folder name postgwas-db-grch38-2025-11

# in the repo directory run:

docker run -it --rm --name postgwas-pipeline \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v "/nf-postgwas:/nf-postgwas" \
  -v "/nf-postgwas/results:/nf-postgwas/results" \
  -v "/nf-postgwas/work:/nf-postgwas/work" \
  -e NXF_WORK="/nf-postgwas/work" \
  -w /nf-postgwas \
  postgwas-pipeline

conda activate postgwas_py39
nextflow run . -profile local -params-file params.yaml
```
