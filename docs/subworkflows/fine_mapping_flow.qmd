title: FINE_MAPPING_FLOW
---

Fine-mapping narrows credible causal variants at each locus. The current default method is Wakefield.

Key responsibilities

- Compute Wakefield-style posterior probabilities and credible sets.
- Produce credible set outputs consumable by annotation and plotting steps.

Important parameters

- `run_fine_mapping` and `fine_mapping_method` (default: `wakefield`).

Outputs

- Credible set tables and annotated VCFs for downstream tools.
