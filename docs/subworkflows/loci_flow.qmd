title: LOCI_FLOW
---

LOCI_FLOW identifies genome-wide significant loci from GWAS summary statistics and produces per-locus GWAS files used by downstream steps.

Key responsibilities

- Identify lead variants (p < 5e-8) and prune nearby variants.
- Produce locus-specific GWAS files for fine-mapping, plotting, and coloc.

Important parameters

- `run_loci` - enable/disable loci discovery.
- distance and windowing defaults are in the process scripts and `params.yaml`.

Outputs

- `compiled_loci.csv` and per-locus GWAS files in results folders.
