title: PRIORITISATION_FLOW
---

PRIORITISATION_FLOW integrates evidence (PoPS, enrichment, coloc, variant annotation, ClinGen/OMIM) to score genes within loci.

Key responsibilities

- Combine multiple evidence sources and assign prioritisation scores.
- Produce a ranked list of candidate genes per locus.

Important parameters

- `run_prioritisation` and related toggles for included evidence sources.

Outputs

- Prioritised gene tables used by Druggability analysis.
