title: Subworkflows
---

This page summarises the pipeline subworkflows. Each subworkflow has its own page explaining inputs, outputs and important parameters.

- PREP: data preprocessing, merging per-chromosome GWAS, QC, liftover, RSID mapping.
- LOCI: identify genome-wide significant loci and create locus-specific GWAS files.
- LD: produce LD annotation and r2-based proxies for loci.
- LOCI_GROUPS: group loci into blocks using proximity and LD.
- VARIANT_ANNOT: annotate variants (CADD, pCHiC, RegulomeDB).
- FINE_MAPPING: Wakefield fine-mapping and credible sets.
- MAGMA: gene-based analysis.
- PoPS: gene prioritisation using PoPS (requires MAGMA).
- COLOC: colocalisation with GTEx and custom traits.
- ENRICHMENT: gene-set enrichment analyses.
- PRIORITISATION: integrate multiple lines of evidence to prioritise genes.
- DRUGGABILITY: annotate drug-target information for prioritised genes.
- PLOTTING: generate summary plots and locus plots.
