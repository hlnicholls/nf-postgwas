This guide covers how to develop and test changes to the pipeline.

Project layout highlights

- `main.nf` - top-level workflow wiring subworkflows.
- `subworkflows/` - each subworkflow is a separate Nextflow file (e.g. `prep_flow.nf`).
- `bin/`, `modules/` - helper scripts and modules used by the pipeline.
- `conf/` - configuration profiles (local, hpc, base).

Adding or modifying a subworkflow

1. Create or edit `subworkflows/<name>_flow.nf` and expose inputs/outputs as channels.
2. Update `main.nf` to include the subworkflow and add toggles in `params.yaml` / `nextflow.config`.
3. Add or update tests in `tests/` and run the `test` profile.

Testing locally

- Use the `test` profile for quick smoke checks: `nextflow run . -profile test`.
- Use the Docker image for reproducible environments.

Coding conventions

- Keep scripts idempotent and avoid writing to fixed paths outside `params.output_path`.
- Prefer small, single-purpose processes in Nextflow for easier resource tuning.
